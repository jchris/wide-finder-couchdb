This is a rough analog of Tim Bray's Wide Finder benchmark, using CouchDB.

I haven't started optimizing it yet, but on the initial test data, it takes about 5 minutes to compute the results.

CouchDB has a very different performance profile than other processes in the WF Challenge. I fully expect CouchDB to be slower than the other entries. Maybe even a lot slower, for the initial calculation of results.

However, CouchDB stores intermediate results. This means that if you were to add lines a few at a time, and query the totals occasionally, you'd get near instantaneous results all the time.

CouchDB's concurrency model means that it makes a good candidate for a logging platform. Just post lines to CouchDB from your application, and let it handle keeping the reports up to date.

You can even change the report ranges arbitrarily. Just the top 404's from this month, or this set of URLs? No problem.
